Project 1: Probability Distributions and Bayesian Networks.
Project concerns probability distributions of several variables. We will use Python to evaluate sufficient statistics:
mean and variance of univariate distributions and covariance and correlation coefficient of pairs
of variables. We will then use these statistics to construct compact representations of joint
probability distributions known as Bayesian networks.

Project 2: Using machine learning to solve a problem that arises in Information Retrieval,
one known as the Learning to Rank (LeToR) problem.

Project 3: Classification of handwritten digits using Neural networks.
Project is to implement and evaluate classification algorithms. The classification task will be to
recognize a 28 X 28 grayscale handwritten digit image and identify it as a digit among 0, 1, 2, ... , 9.

Project 4: Classification of celeb images using Convolutional neural networks.
Task is to implement a convolution neural network to determine whether the
person in a portrait image is wearing glasses or not. We will use the Celeb dataset which has more
than 200k celebrity images in total. In this task you are to use a publicly available convolutional
neural network package, train it on the Celeb images, tune hyperparameters and apply regularization
to improve performance.
